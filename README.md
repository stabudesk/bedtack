# bedtack

The name was chosen principally because it "tackles" BED files and the name BEDtools and BEDutils imply a much bigger platform of tools while this project is rather small.

The name also has a fuzzy evocation of "BED attack" or "BED tuck" which all imply a certain handling of the BED file format which actually varies quite a bit, principally on the number of columns it has.

If you do not have a BED file, but rather have a GFF file, there are tools out there to do the conversion, so it's not part of the current scope.
